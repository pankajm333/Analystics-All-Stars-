## Key Considerations for Dashboard Design

### Color Selection
- Choose primary and/or secondary colors based on the corporate identity or industry.
- Use theme colors for various dashboard elements such as page background, container background, borders, text, etc.

### Font Selection
- Choose fonts based on the identity/industry/subject.
- Determine the size for KPI values, title text, value texts, and paragraph texts.

### Positioning
- Place elements in horizontal/vertical positions in multiples of 8 or 4.
- Maintain proper distances between elements to avoid congestion.
- Stick to aspect ratios to keep visuals appealing.

### Dashboard Creation Steps

1. **Load Data**: Load data into Power BI Desktop from a CSV file.
2. **Data Quality Check**: Use Power Query Editor to check column distribution, quality, and profile.
3. **Error Handling**: Handle errors and empty values in columns.
4. **Report Design**: 
    - Use themes for consistency.
    - Add visual filters (slicers) for Class, Customer Type, Gate Location, and Type of Travel.
    - Create visuals for average delay, customer ratings, and other key metrics.
5. **Text and Image Addition**: Add text boxes with company name and tagline. Insert company logo and other relevant images.
6. **Calculated Columns and Measures**:
    - Create calculated columns and measures for additional insights.
7. **Publish to Power BI Service**: Publish the report to Power BI Service.
